# Final Project Tableau
### Project Goal
To better understand the relationship between flight and animal strikes. Three aspect of the dataset os analyzed:
- The wildlife characteristics
- The time of strikes
- The effect of strikes
### Process 
- Understand all aspect the dataset about animal strikes by using different table and chart to explore and evaluate the dataset.
- Clean dataset from all null, inappropriate data types and duplicate data with python.
- Create visualization to explain the questions about the dataset.
- Evaluate the visualization to explain business questions.
### Results
- Most of the air strikes of animals in the US are link to birds, especially during August. The strikes lightly to happen on daytime and mostly during approach, landing, take off and climb phrases of the flights.
- We also understand that for geological and natural features, some state might expect a significant higher number of strikes such as Texas, California, Florida or New York\
### Challenges
- Different numeric data is seem relational, which increase the bias of the analysis
- Cost is unpredictable base on simple regression model
### Future goal
- Access different aspect of the data set to generate more actionable insights.
